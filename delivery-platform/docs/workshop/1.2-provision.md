In this lab, you will execute initial setup steps to configure your workspace for use with this workshop. You will also review key Terraform files for use in your own customizations in the future. Finally, you will initiate the provision process to create the software delivery platform used in this workshop.

## Objectives

- Setup Workspace
- Review overall folder structure
- Review Terraform components (Remote state, Networking, Clusters)
- Review the Cloud Build job for platform provisioning
- Submit the job to provision platform

Click **Start** to proceed.

## Select a project

Choose a project for this tutorial. The project will contain the services and tools to build and deploy applications and the GKE clusters that will act as your development, staging, and production environments.

**We recommend you create a new project for this tutorial. You may experience undesired side effects if you use an existing project with conflicting settings. If you are using QwikLabs, choose the project starting with _qwiklabs-_**

<walkthrough-project-setup></walkthrough-project-setup>

Change into the `delivery-platform` directory

```bash
cd delivery-platform
```

Click **Next** to proceed.

## Submit the job to provision platform

In this step, you will run a command to begin provisioning the platform used in this workshop.

All of the steps have been tied together for you in a single script. When customizing your own platform, you can utilize only the pieces and sequences that apply in the context of your requirements.

While the script is running, you will review the details of the scripts and resources.

First, take a moment to review the complete provision script. Note how each section is broken out for easy execution and customization.

<walkthrough-editor-open-file filePath="delivery-platform/resources/provision/provision-all.sh">Review the provision-all.sh file</walkthrough-editor-open-file>

### Provision
The provision process begins by prompting you for three values. 

First you will be prompted to select your git provider, and then your git username. Choose Github for the provider and enter your github username. 

Next you will be prompted to provide a github personal access token. A link is provided in the terminal to help you generate one. Click on the link and provide a name such as DeliveryWorkshop for the token. Once generated copy the token and paste into the terminal. 

The final prompt will be asking for an API key. Again a link is provided that will take you to the credentials page where you will create the key. Instructions are provided in the terminal. Once completed copy the API key and paste into the terminal. 


To initiate the process execute the following commands.

 ```bash
gcloud config set project {{project-id}}
source ./env.sh
${BASE_DIR}/resources/provision/provision-all.sh
 ```

The provision process will take approximately 20 minutes to complete. Continue with this and future labs while the script is provisioning. 

 **Note:** You do not need to wait for the provisioning process to complete before continuing. 

Click **Next** to proceed.

## Review overall folder structure

This repository provides a variety of resources for use both in a workshop setting as well as during your own exploration and customization. The majority of key resources are located in the `delivery-platform` folder.

![](https://crg-sdw-imgs.web.app/folder-structure.png)

### Docs

The `delivery-platform/docs` folder contains instructions for demos and workshops. The file you're reading right now is located here as well. You can view it by opening <walkthrough-editor-open-file filePath="delivery-platform/docs/workshop/1.2-provision.md">delivery-platform/docs/workshop/1.2-provision.md</walkthrough-editor-open-file>.

### Scripts

The `delivery-platform/scripts` folder contains a few key scripts you'll review in later sections. In practice, you'll incorporate scripts like  <walkthrough-editor-open-file filePath="delivery-platform/scripts/hydrate.sh">delivery-platform/scripts/hydrate.sh</walkthrough-editor-open-file> into your own software delivery pipelines.

### Workdir

The `delivery-platform/workdir` folder is used during the workshop as a temporary workspace to house various folders and files either managed by the tools or modified by you in the lessons. One example is your environment state file <walkthrough-editor-open-file filePath="delivery-platform/workdir/state.env">delivery-platform/workdir/state.env</walkthrough-editor-open-file> that contains various variables, including your clear text GitHub token. This entire folder is ignored by git and can be deleted safely at the completion of your workshop.

### Resources

The final directory of note is the `delivery-platform/resources` folder. This directory contains sample repositories used throughout the lessons and a series of Terraform scripts used to provision the platform.

Click **Next** to proceed.

In this lab, you'll provision the underlying infrastructure needed to run the workshop. A software delivery platform consists of four main components: Foundation, Clusters, Tools, and Applications.  

### Foundation

The foundation includes all of the base GCP resources needed for the software delivery platform in general. In practice, this may include enabling APIs, setting up IAM resources and VPC networks, among others things. In this example, you're creating the underlying networking used throughout the workshop.

<walkthrough-editor-open-file filePath="delivery-platform/resources/provision/foundation/tf/networks.tf">

</walkthrough-editor-open-file>

This file can be adjusted to meet your organizational needs.

### Remote State
The Terraform scripts in this workshop utilize remote state management to ensure the state is persisted between users and workspaces. If you were to lose your Cloud Shell instance or chose to access the scripts from another device, remote state management would allow you to interact with your Terraform environment correctly.

This state is provided by defining a backend of type Google Cloud Storage (GCS) as seen in `/foundation/tf/backend.tmpl`

<walkthrough-editor-select-line filePath="delivery-platform/resources/provision/foundation/tf/backend.tmpl"
                                startLine="17" startCharacterOffset="0"
                                endLine="19" endCharacterOffset="99">
Click here to view the code.
</walkthrough-editor-select-line>

The values in this file are replaced with your actual project name and the file is renamed to `backend.tf` automatically in a later step.

Click **Next** to proceed.

## Clusters

Three clusters are created as part of this workshop: `dev`, `stage`, and `prod`.

* The `prod` cluster will act as a production resource.
* The `stage` cluster will act as a pre-production resource.
* The `dev` cluster is used by the application teams for application development and testing. The `dev` cluster is also used to run the various management, build and deployment tools needed by your delivery process.

Applications are deployed to production and staging through your delivery pipeline.

In the lab, you are using GKE zonal clusters for cost-saving. To use regional clusters or configure the clusters,
you can modify the `clusters/tf/clusters.tf` file. <walkthrough-editor-open-file filePath="delivery-platform/resources/provision/clusters/tf/clusters.tf">
Click here to review the current configuration
</walkthrough-editor-open-file>

Click **Next** to proceed.

## Sample Repositories

A series of sample repositories are provided for use in the workshop. These provide a consistent base configuration for the clusters and the applications that will be deployed on the platform. More details of these repositories and concepts will be covered in later labs.

In this step of the provisioning process, the scripts will create and push new repos in your git provider for each of these sample repos. From then on, the workshop will use the repos located in your git provider.

These sample repositories can also be used to speed up the customization of your own platform.

<walkthrough-editor-open-file filePath="delivery-platform/resources/repos/README.md">
Review the folders in the `resources/repos` directory
</walkthrough-editor-open-file>

Click **Next** to proceed.


## Review the Cloud Build job for platform provisioning

This workshop utilizes Cloud Build to manage the execution of the Terraform scripts used to provision the platform.

Executing these steps with Cloud Build allows you to include the exact set of tools and utilities needed for your provisioning process, not having to depend on the user to install tools locally.

Additionally, running in this fully managed runtime ensures that any issues with local connectivity or session state won't impact the execution of the job.

### cloudbuild.yaml
To submit workloads to Cloud Build, a `cloudbuild.yaml` file is submitted through the gcloud CLI

<walkthrough-editor-select-line filePath="delivery-platform/resources/provision/foundation/tf/cloudbuild.yaml"
                                startLine="36" startCharacterOffset="0"
                                endLine="41" endCharacterOffset="99">
Review the key lines of the foundation/tf/cloudbuild.yaml
</walkthrough-editor-select-line>

## Congratulations !!

You've reached the end of this lab!

At this point, you'll probably still have tabs in your editor open from reviewing the various files. Go ahead and close out of those files. 

Also, your provisioning process may not be complete yet. Go ahead and open a new cloud shell terminal to continue with the next few labs. 

<walkthrough-open-cloud-shell-button></walkthrough-open-cloud-shell-button>

Once the shell opens runthe following commands to return to the workshop state. 

```bash
gcloud config set project {{project-id}}
cd cloudshell_open/software-delivery-workshop/delivery-platform/
source ./env.sh

```

Next, your instructor will discuss the concepts related to the next section.

After the lecture, run the following command to launch the next lab.

```bash
teachme "${BASE_DIR}/docs/workshop/1.3-kustomize.md"
```
