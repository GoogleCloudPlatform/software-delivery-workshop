# Release Progression w/ Git Event

In this lab, you will implement a release progression process that utilizes git events as the primary workflow. Using git to manage the process allows organizations to move many of the stage gates and checks towards the development team. While this practice is a core concept in the popular gitops practices, git-based workflows can be used with traditional imperative as well as gitops oriented declarative processes. 

## Objectives
- Review lifecycle variations
- Create commit & tag triggers
- Initiate a release
- Approve a release



Click **Start** to begin the lab.

## Prerequisites 

This lab assumes you have already cloned the main repository and are starting in the `delivery-platform/` folder. 

This lab also assumes you are continuing from the previous lab and should still have the hello-web app in your workdir. 


### Setup your environment

<walkthrough-project-setup></walkthrough-project-setup>

Execute the following command to set your project and local environment variables

```bash
gcloud config set project {{project-id}}
source ./env.sh
export APP_NAME=hello-web
```


## CI/CD Models and Workflows

### Source control models
There are many models for how exactly to structure your branches and releases. This lab follows a model similar to how Google manages code, but the techniques can be applied to any model.

At Google, software engineers create a branch for small updates to the code base. These changes are then submitted for validation and review as a ChangeList (CL). The CL process runs automated tests as well as requiring approval by code owners. Once approved, the code is automatically integrated into the main code base, and is a candidate to be deployed in the next release. Change management for a production release is handled through a separate process, but once approved the code is pulled from the main line. 

To approximate this model in Git, this lab assumes the following model:

* Tags represent production releases.
* The Main branch represents code ready for production, or "staged" for production.
* Any development efforts are handled on branches other than Main.

The PR process in most Git providers allows you to implement your own review processes. Many providers allow you to restrict which users are allowed to perform actions on the various branches and tags, which can be used for separation of concerns. 

### Git events for workflow
A central part of any CI/CD system utilizes git events as the trigger for continuous processes. 

This lab is currently triggered by events from pushes to branches as well as the creation of new tags. 

Click **Next** to begin reviewing the implementation. 

## Review what Onboarding setup

Earlier, you created an application using the scripts provided on this platform. In that process, a few key elements were set up for your application to enable the workflow in this lab. 

### Webhooks
Whenever events occur within your provider, the events can trigger a request to an external endpoint called a webhook. A webhook was created and configured for your `hello-web` application during the onboard process. You can review it in the settings section of your repository. 

Execute the following command to generate a link to that location in your project.  

```bash
echo $GIT_BASE_URL/$APP_NAME/settings/hooks
```
Copy the value and paste it into a new browser tab to review the webhook on your application repo. 

### Triggers

The webhook is configured to call an endpoint with details about the event that occurred. The onboarding script created an endpoint in Google Cloud to accept these webhook requests. 

Review the trigger setup for your application in Cloud Build with the link below
#### If you chose ACM as continuous delivery platform:
[https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/triggers/edit/hello-web-webhook-trigger](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/triggers/edit/hello-web-webhook-trigger)
#### If you chose Clouddeploy as continuous delivery platform:
[https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/triggers/edit/hello-web-webhook-trigger](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/triggers/edit/hello-web-clouddeploy-webhook-trigger)

### Workflow Configuration
#### If you chose ACM as continuous delivery platform
The webhook endpoint triggers a Cloud Build job that executes a workflow defined in a `cloudbuild.yaml` file. The cloud build implementation includes steps to clone the repo, build and push an image, hydrate resources, and finally deploy the assets to the appropriate environment. 

Review the `cloudbuild.yaml` in your `hello-web` project
<walkthrough-editor-open-file filePath="delivery-platform/workdir/hello-web/build/cloudbuild.yaml">
Click here to open cloudbuild.yaml
</walkthrough-editor-open-file>

#### If you chose Clouddeploy as continuous delivery platform
The webhook endpoint triggers a Cloud Build job that executes a workflow defined in a `cloudbuild-cd.yaml` file. The cloud build implementation includes steps to clone the repo, build and push an image, and finally create pipelines for deployment in stage and prod.

Review the `cloudbuild-cd.yaml` in your `hello-web` project
<walkthrough-editor-open-file filePath="delivery-platform/workdir/hello-web/build/cloudbuild-cd.yaml">
Click here to open cloudbuild-cd.yaml
</walkthrough-editor-open-file>

### View Initial Deployment
During the onboarding process, the workflow was exercised for the first time to create an initial deployment for your application. You can see your application running from the GKE Workloads page:

Note: If you chose Clouddeploy as delivery system, the pipelines created in previous steps automatically runs in its first target which is stage and completes the deployment.
[Cick here to view the deployment](https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes/workload)

Now since these services are not exposed publicly, you'll need to create a tunnel to the cluster to view the web page. 

Execute the following command to create the stage tunnel

```bash
kubectx stage \
 && kubectl port-forward --namespace hello-web $(kubectl get pod --namespace hello-web --selector="app=hello-web,role=backend" --output jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') 8080:8080
 ```

With multiple clusters configured, you could use `kubectl` to switch context. In this lab, we use `kubectx`, a command available in Cloud Shell to help you manage and switch context. 

When that's' running, you can select the web preview in the top right of the screen, just to the left of your profile icon. Selecting "Preview on port 8080" will open a view of the app in the cluster. 

Exit out of the tunnel by typing `ctrl+c` in the terminal on your keyboard 

## Deploy code to Stage clusters 

Change the output of your hello-web application to say "Hello World - V2" 

<walkthrough-editor-select-line filePath="delivery-platform/workdir/hello-web/main.go"
                                startLine="30" startCharacterOffset="1"
                                endLine="30" endCharacterOffset="80">
Changed this line 
</walkthrough-editor-select-line> 


Commit the code to the main branch by executing the following command

```bash
cd $WORK_DIR/hello-web
git add . 
git commit -m "Updating to V2"
git push origin main
```
Review the Cloud Build trigger in progress by cicking into the latest job on [the build history page](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/builds)

#### If you chose ACM as continuous delivery platform
When the Cloud Build trigger completes, you can review the updated change by opening your tunnel

```bash
kubectx stage \
 && kubectl port-forward --namespace hello-web $(kubectl get pod --namespace hello-web --selector="app=hello-web,role=backend" --output jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') 8080:8080
 ```

And again utilizing the web preview in the top right

When you're done use `ctrl+c` in the terminal to exit out of the tunnel

#### If you chose Clouddeploy as continuous delivery platform
When the Cloud Build trigger completes, it will create a Clouddeploy pipeline in your project. Review it by clicking [Clouddeploy pipelines](https://pantheon.corp.google.com/deploy/delivery-pipelines).
You will see that the pipeline contains two stages : stage and prod. When the pipeline is created, it automatically deploys to stage environment.
![](https://crg-sdw-imgs.web.app/clouddeploy-stage.png)
Click the three dots on stage pipeline box and choose "View release" to see more details.
Now, you can review the updated change by opening your tunnel

```bash
kubectx stage \
 && kubectl port-forward --namespace hello-web $(kubectl get pod --namespace hello-web --selector="app=hello-web,role=backend" --output jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') 8080:8080
 ```

## Release code to prod

#### If you chose ACM as continuous delivery platform

Releases to production are also triggered through git events. In this case, the creation of a tag is the triggering event instead of code being pushed to a branch.

Create a release by executing the following command

```bash
git tag v2
git push origin v2
```
Again review the latest job progress in the [the build history page](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/builds)

When complete review the page live by creating your tunnel


```bash
kubectx prod \
 && kubectl port-forward --namespace hello-web $(kubectl get pod --namespace hello-web --selector="app=hello-web,role=backend" --output jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') 8080:8080
 ```

And again utilizing the web preview in the top right

When you're done use `ctrl+c` in the terminal to exit out of the tunnel

#### If you chose Clouddeploy as continuous delivery platform
Go to the pipipeline created earlier by clicking [Clouddeploy pipelines](https://pantheon.corp.google.com/deploy/delivery-pipelines).


A "promote" link will appear on stage box, click it. It will open a dialog box, select Prod as target and click Promote button at the bottom left.
It will trigger the release in Prod. Once the pipeline finishes, you will see Prod pipelines in green status as shown in the pic below.

![](https://crg-sdw-imgs.web.app/clouddeploy-prod.png)
Now, review the page live by creating your tunnel
```bash
kubectx prod \
 && kubectl port-forward --namespace hello-web $(kubectl get pod --namespace hello-web --selector="app=hello-web,role=backend" --output jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') 8080:8080
 ```
