# Sample Repos

The sample repos provided in this directory are push to your git provider as part of the provisioning process. From then on the workshop and platform will utilize the repositories located in your git provider. 

This directory contains a simple `cluster-config` repo designed for use with Anthos Config Manager. 

Additional repositories are provided for application templates and the associated kustomize folders. To add aditional app templates, simply create the appropriate structures in the `app-templates` and `shared-kustomize` tempalates forlder prior to provisioning, or add them directly to your git provider's repo anytime after provisioning.
